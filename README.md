This website was designed to present my PM566 course's final project: Anlysis the relationship between influenza vaccination coverage and Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) mortality rates by state in the US (2009-2019).

The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between influenza vaccination coverage and P&I mortality rates during the specified time frame. Understanding this relationship can provide insights into the effectiveness of vaccination programs and the impact of vaccination on P&I-related mortality. It also allows for an assessment of geographic variations, highlighting areas with successful vaccination programs and areas where improvements may be needed.
